# C Projects

These are my solutions to windows operating systems assignments. Detailed infomration about the projects can be found [here.](http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs30200-2018/homework.html)

### What are the assignments about?

     1. A "filter program" that results random data into specified decimal points format.
     2. A  "launcher" program that creates Windows processes.
     3. A simple "scheduler" program.
